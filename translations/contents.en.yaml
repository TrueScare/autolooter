    title: 'But how does it all work?'
    content: "<p>
      Autolooter works on the basis of  <a href='{{ path('table_index') }}'>tables</a>.
      The tables in turn contain other table or <a href='{{ path('item_index') }}'>items</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      
      The tables and items are assigned <a href='{{ path('rarity_index') }}'>rarities</a>
      created by you. You may recognize the principle from computer games such as World of Warcraft or Borderlands.
      Jede Seltenheit bekommt von dir einen Wert zugeschrieben. You assign a value to each rarity. This is later used to 
      calculate the probability of drawing an item. The whole thing is based on the  
      <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urn_problem' target='_blank'>urn problem</a>.

            If you don't have an account yet, just <a href='{{ path('app_register') }}'>register</a>. The whole thing
            is 100% cost and ad-free and nothing happens to your data here.
        </p>
        <p>
            The best place to start is with the <a href='{{ path('rarity_index') }}'>rarities</a>. These are required 
            for both the tables and the items. Then create your first <a href='{{ path('table_index') }}'>table</a>. 
            Each item must be assigned to a table.Finally, you can simply create your 
            <a href='{{ path('item_index') }}'>items</a>.
